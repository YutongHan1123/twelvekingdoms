						<p>We are familiar with the western fantasy world, like Harry Potter, Game of Thrones. But do you know the eastern fantasy world? Maybe you are an anime fan and you are familiar with One Piece, Naruto. However, I guess you never watch, even didn’t hear this anime-the Twelve Kingdoms.</p>
						<p>The work, the Twelve Kingdoms, originally is a series of fantasy novels written by Fuyumi Ono, then made into an anime in 2002.</p>
						<p>The world of the Twelve Kingdoms is based on the coexistence of youma (monster), and sages. The political institution is similar to ancient China, especially Zhou dynasty.</p>
						<p>There are twelve kingdoms, twelve kings and twelve kirins. Kirin possess the form of creature resembling a hybrid between a horse and a deer with a single horn from its forehead, somewhat like a unicorn. Kirin can shift into human form. Each kingdom has its own kirin.</p>
						<a class="image featured"><img src="images/kirin.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Kirin</p>

						<p>The king is selected by the kirin, rather than by blood or familial relationships, according to the will of Tentei, the Emperor of Heaven.
						</p>
						<a class="image featured"><img src="images/kirin2.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Kirin</p>

						<p>In the world of The Twelve Kingdoms, the king has to follow three rules, or the king will die. First one is working hard to run the country. If the king does great job, he will be undead and ageless, like vampires. If the king becomes brutal, unmerciful, loses the way and fails to govern properly, the kirin will be sick, which is called Shitsudou. If the king keeps wrongheaded, the sickness of kirin gets worse with time and causes the kirin to die. If the kirin dies, the king will lose the mandate of heaven and eventually die within a year of the kirin's death. Typically, a king with a long and stable reign will have a prosperous and thriving kingdom, while short-lived monarchs tend to leave their kingdoms in a state of turmoil that wild youma appears, and weather becomes harsh.
						</p>
						<a class="image featured"><img src="images/sick_kirin.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Sicked Kirin</p>

						<p>The second rule is that the king can’t escape his responsibility to be the king. If the king decides to reject the will of Tentei, he will quickly die.
						</p>
						<p>The third rule is that the king from one country can’t interfere, or send an army into battle to other countries without consent. If the king intervenes or dispatches, the king and the kirin will quickly die (触犯侵略之罪<觌面之罪>).</p>
						<p>In the Twelve Kingdoms, eight of the Twelve Kingdoms border at least one of these four seas, extending from the center like the petals of a flower. The kingdoms are surrounded by an endless sea called the Kyokai (虚海, Void Sea). At the center of the world are Five Sacred Mountains surround the Yellow Sea (the Kokai), a barren wasteland of rock, desert, swamp, and thorns where youma inhabit. The Five Sacred Mountains, which includes Mount Hou, is the mythic birthplace of kirin where all the kings of the Twelve Kingdoms must ascend in order to accept the mandate of heaven before they can claim their throne.</p>
						<p>Before we begin the story of the Twelve Kingdoms, there is one last thing you need to know, Shoku. Shoku(蝕) are magical storms that connects the Twelve Kingdoms’ world to the lands of Hourai (Japan) and Kan (China). People might be transformed between these two worlds during Shoku. The storms naturally occur, but are extremely damaging to the world it impacts. Unless absolutely compelled, kirin and highly ranked sages shall not cross between the worlds in this way.</p>
						<p>Above are basic settings for the world of the Twelve Kingdoms. As one of Fuyumi's big fans, I’d like to invite you to enjoy the unique world through data visualization.</p>

						<p>Youko, who used to be a normal high-schooler in Japan, met a strange tall man with golen yellow hair. He said "I'm Keiki, my lord." He asked her to consent or all people will die. After Youko agreed, she was suddenly attacked by a sea of youma and whisked her away to an unearthly realm. Youko is left with only a sword. This young girl had to quickly grow up to confront ample challenges. During the adventure, she gradually found she is not a normal person anymore.

											<p>There can be no doubt that the bubble of <strong>Youko</strong> is the biggest. She is the main character and this novel is talking about her adventure in the unknown world. Youko is regarded as a <a href="#Kaikyaku" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Kaikyaku</a> after she went to the world of the Twelve Kingdoms. She was both hunted by the <a href="#Youma" class="setting_text3 scrolly">youma</a> and the people in country Kou, because the <a href="#KingKou" class="setting_text3 scrolly">king of Kou</a> dislike Kaikyaku and Hanjyuu (a half-beast that has both a human and an animal form).</p>
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/youko.png" alt="" /></a>
											<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Youko is facing the youma.</p>

											<p>And the second large bubble is <strong>Rakushun</strong>, Youko’s close friend. When Youko’s strength gave out and fell into a coma, Rakushun took her home, rather than reported her to the local ruler. Though Youko was initially distrustful of him, he patiently took care of Youko. He is very intelligent and knowledgeable, teaching Youko essential skills on how to live in the world. Youko went to the country En, where is peaceful and prosperous, to find a way back to Japan, accompanied by Rakushun. During the travel, they became close friends. In the chart, the line between them is also the thickest. The number is 117 that they appeared together in the novel.</p>
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/care.png" alt="" /></a>
											<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Rakushun took care of Youko.</p>

											<p>The third biggest bubble is the <strong>sword</strong>, Suiguutou. It’s a sword that can be wielded only by the rightful king of Kei. Its most dangerous ability is the power to present visions of past and future, and of places far-away to bewitch the wielder. Sword and scabbard sealed each other, so that the scabbard controlled the sword's visions and prevented people from drawing the sword, while the sword prevented the monkey spirit from getting loose. Youko loses the scabbard, and thus gets taunted by both visions and the monkey until she kills the monkey and picks up the dead scabbard.</p>

												<p>Unlike the first novel, this one has three main characters. We can see the bubble of <a href="#Suzu" class="setting_text1 scrolly">Suzu</a> is the biggest, 634. The second bubble represents <a href="#Shoukei" class="setting_text1 scrolly">Shoukei</a>, 553. The third biggest one is Youko, 464. Suzu and Shoukei wanted to see the king of Kei because they are similar-age gils, so we can see their bubbles are linked by "Imperial Kei" and "girl". </p>

												<header class="main_character">
													<h3 id="Suzu">Suzu</h3>
												</header>
												<p>At the beginning of the story, Suzu thought she was the most miserable person in the world, because she can’t talk with other people as a Kaikyaku, then was forced to endure a great deal of abuse from her lord, <a href="#Riyou" class="setting_text4 scrolly">Riyou</a>. From the chart, the number is 42 when Suzu and Riyou appeared together. She believed Youko can let her happy because Youko is Kaikyaku, too, and Youko is the powerful empress of country Kei. In this case, she left to see Youko.</p>

												<p>She was changed by a young boy called Seishu on the way. Seishu lost his parents by youma’s attacks. He was also heavily injured by the attack. The injury gradually grows worse and is the source of seizures and his failing eyesight. Even his situation was so terrible, he always faced life with a smile. He pointed out <strong>Suzu made no actual effort to try to change those circumstances and only moped about how unfortunate she was</strong>. Suzu gradually recognized her mistake and they became friends.</p>

												<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Seishu and Suzu</p>

												<p>However, Seishuu is deliberately run over by the carriage of the prefecture's praetor, <a href="#Shoukou" class="setting_text3 scrolly">Shoukou</a>, for collapsing in the carriage's path. Suzu swore to avenge Seishuu by killing Shoukou and the king of Kei for her inaction. She was quickly recruited by the leader of the Shisui rebels, <a href="#Koshou" class="setting_text2 scrolly">Koshou</a>. From the chart, the number is 54 when Suzu and Koshou appeared together. They fought together to overthrow the rule of Shoukou.</p>

												<p>Shoukei used to be the princess of the Kingdom of Hou. Her father was killed due to <a href="#Shitsudou" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Shitsudou</a>. And she quickly became a poor, heavy manual worker, hated by Hou’s people. In the beginning, she deeply hated <a href="#Gekkei" class="setting_text2 scrolly">Gekkei</a>, because Gekkei killed her parents. She thought Gekkei stole the throne, robbed her jewelry, beautiful clothes. She heard the new king of Kei is a girl of similar age with her. She was very jealous. She wanted to take advantage of Youko. In this case, she stole some jewelry to make her way to Kei.</p>

												<p>Shoukei met Rakushun on the way. She felt mortifying and irritating when she found <a href="#Rakushun" class="setting_text2 scrolly">Rakushun</a> knows more about Hou than her. Her father executed nearly 300,000 citizens in Hou for petty crimes and trivial problems in the final year of his reign. And she didn’t know about that. She recognized she just enjoyed the life of the princess, but not took the responsibility as a princess. It’s more shame than wearing in rags.</p>
												<a class="image featured"><img src="images/sho.png" alt="" /></a>
												<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Shoukei feels shame.</p>

												<p>After arriving Kei, Shoukei witnessed a man condemned to be crucified in the Wa Province. Reminded of her father's own brutality, she throws a rock at the executioners to stop them from killing the poor man. Then she was chased by guards until she was saved by <a href="#Kantai" class="setting_text2 scrolly">Kantai</a>. After that, Shoukei joined rebels revolting against Shoukou, the corrupt governor of Wa.</p>

						<h2>The Shore in Twilight, The Sky at Daybreak</h2>
						<div class="narrow-width">
						<p>Fifteen years before Youko's arrival in the Twelve Kingdoms, the kirin of Tai, Taiki's <a href="#Ranka" class="setting_text5 scrolly">ranka</a> had been blown over to Japan by a <a href="#Shoku" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Shoku</a>. He lived in Japan for 10 years and didn’t know himself is a kirin. Then he was returned to <a href="#MountHou" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Mount Hou</a> after being found by <a href="#Enki" class="setting_text2 scrolly">Enki</a>. Taiki is cared for and educated in his role as the kirin of Tai. And Taiki successfully chose
							<a href="#Gyousou" class="setting_text1 scrolly">Gyousou</a> to become king.</p>
						<br>
						<a class="image featured"><img src="images/taiki.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Taiki was very happy in Mount Hou.</p>

						<p>However, there was a conspiracy waiting for them. Just after half a year, the kingdom of Tai falls, both the King of Tai and Taiki went missing. The number of youma gradually became more and more. The population was dramatically decreasing. In desperation, <a href="#Risai" class="setting_text1 scrolly">Risai</a>, a general of Tai, manages to escape the kingdom and flees to Kei, where she beseeches the empress of Kei, Youko, to help find Taiki.</p>

											<section id="book3"></section>
											<p>From the chart, we can clearly notice that the biggest bubble is <a href="#Risai" class="setting_text1 scrolly">“Risai”</a>. Risai appeared 643 times in this novel. Because she fled to country Kei to beg Youko to find Taiki. When Youko agreed to her request, she fell into a coma due to terrible hurt. when she waked up, she lost her right arm due to serious injuries in exile. But she didn’t care. Risai was more worried about Taiki. </p>
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/risai2.png" alt="" /></a>
											<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Youko is talking with Risai.</p>

											<p>You can see the number of times between Risai and Taiki appear together. It is the thickest line in this novel with 67 times. Risai missed Taiki so much. The second thickest line is the relationship between Youko and Risai. Youko keeps telling the progress of finding Taiki to Risai. Risai is very grateful for Youko’s help.</p>

											<p>Taiki is the second biggest bubble in the novel. 7 kings and kirins stood together to help the country Tai. They found out Taiki invoked meishoku, a special small <a href="#Shoku" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Shoku</a>, before Taiki’s missing. Meishoku happens when the kirin is under extreme stress or danger.</p>
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/taiki2.png" alt="" /></a>
											<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Taiki went back to Japan and lost his memory as a kirin after his horn cut.</p>

											<p>In fact, Taiki’s horn was cut by <a href="#Asen" class="setting_text3 scrolly">Asen</a>, the Tai's strongest military commanders, trusted by the king, Gyousou, as a brother. From the chart, we can find that the bubble representing Asen is linked with “Taiki”, “Gyousou”, “Risai” and “emperor”. Asen grievously betrayed the king, Gyousou, and usurped the throne.</p>

											<p>Because Taiki’s horn was cut, and the horn is the source of kirin’s power. Taiki was so painful of losing his horn and created <a href="#Meishoku" class="setting_text5 scrolly">meishoku</a>. And because Taiki was deep hurt, he lost the memory as a kirin, regarding himself as a normal boy in Japan. </p>

											<p>After 7 kings and kirins deciding to help Tai, <a href="#Enki" class="setting_text2 scrolly">Rokuta</a>, <a href="#Keiki" class="setting_text2 scrolly">Keiki</a>, <a href="#Renrin" class="setting_text2 scrolly">Renrin</a> went to Japan many times to find Taiki. Especially Renrin used the royal treasure of Ren, a bracelet called the gogoukanda to find Taiki. Because gogoukanda can open a portal to Japan without causing a <a href="#Shoku" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Shoku</a>, it is instrumental in bringing Taiki back the Twelve Kingdoms.</p>
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/renrin.png" alt="" /></a>
											<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Taiki went to Ren with Renrin on a diplomatic visit 6 years ago.</p>

											<p>At the end of this novel, Taiki was successfully brought back to the world of the Twelve Kingdoms. Taiki and Risai were very grateful to other kings and kirins. Even if Taiki lost his power, he still decided to go back to country Tai to find his lord, Gyousou, and save his country. It’s a duty as a kirin. Risai was worried that she can’t protect Taiki since she lost her right arm. But Taiki persuaded her and they bravely took to the roads leading to the home.</p>

	<div class="narrow-width">
	<p>Shushou, the youngest daughter of a wealthy merchant, had become frustrated by the state of her kingdom. Because of no new king since the death of the previous king 27 years ago, people had to live in danger. Youma has run rampant in country Kyou. She also asked her parents why not going to the Mount Hou for <a href="#Shouzan" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Shouzan</a>. Her parents just laughed, ”Haha, we are just normal people, you are just a little child, you don’t know how dangerous Shouzan is”. She was not satisfied. “Now that those adults are not qualified to be the king of country Kyou, I will be the king to quell the youma, run the country.” She thought.</p>
	<p>As a result, Shushou embarked on the journey of Shouzan.</p>

							<p>As the most important character in this novel, it’s no doubt that Shushou appeared the most times, which are 713 times. At the beginning of the novel, Shushou pretended to mindlessly spill her soup on her servant girl’s cloth. Then she exchanged her cloth with her maid, <a href="#Keika" class="setting_text2 scrolly">Keika</a>. Because she knew it would be dangerous to dress up to the nines as a child after leaving home. Because the country Kyou was very chaotic since the old king died.</p>
							<a class="image featured"><img src="images/shushou.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Shushou is riding <a href="#Hakuto" class="setting_text4 scrolly">Hakuto</a> for Shouzan.</p>

							<p>After taking the opportunity to leave home, Shushou pretended to be a footman, who is sending the moukyoku, <a href="#Hakuto" class="setting_text4 scrolly">Hakuto</a> , to her lord. The road until closing to <a href="#MountHou" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Mount Hou</a> went off successfully. However, the Hakuto was stolen by a group of criminals. Shushou was angry and disappointed. But she didn’t give up. Instead, she was looking for a goushi before going to the <a href="#YellowSea" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Yellow Sea</a>. Shushou knew the road will be very dangerous in the Yellow Sea, full of youma. But she had to pass through the Yellow Sea to Mount Hou. Many people died on the way of <a href="#Shouzan" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Shouzan</a>. Luckily, Gankyuu appeared.</p>

							<p>It’s obvious that Gankyuu is the second important character in the novel, appearing 522 times. The link between Shushou and him is also the thickest, with 150 times. They are always staying together in the novel.</p>
							<a class="image featured"><img src="images/shushou2.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Shushou was forcibly hired Gankyuu to be her goushi.</p>

							<p>Gankyuu is a youma hunter. He is familiar with the dangers of the <a href="#YellowSea" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Yellow Sea</a> surrounding <a href="#MountHou" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Mount Hou</a>. During his first meeting with Shushou, she forcibly hired him to be her goushi when she insists on <a href="#Shouzan" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Shouzan</a>. Unable to persuade her otherwise, he reluctantly goes along with her, initially believing she will be intimidated into giving up upon reading the foot of the mountain because she had become entirely on the impulses of a child. Nevertheless, he was gradually changed by Shushou, and through she can be the new king of Kyou.</p>

							<p>The small group was joint by <a href="#Rikou" class="setting_text2 scrolly">Rikou</a>, a young man from Sou, who befriended Shushou before she hired Gankyuu as her goushi and decides to come along to protect Shushou as well. We can see the links among Shushou, Gankyuu, and Rikou are very thick. They supported each other and fought against youma to go through the <a href="#YellowSea" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Yellow Sea</a>.</p>
							<a class="image featured"><img src="images/rikou.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Rikou</p>

							<p>Compare with other competitors, like <a href="#Kiwa" class="setting_text3 scrolly">Kiwa</a>, Shushou showed calm logic, clear wisdom. And she didn’t give up other people when the youma is tracing them. In fact, she put herself as bait and led those people to kill the youma. She came back several times when she was between death and life.</p>
							<a class="image featured"><img src="images/shushou3.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Shushou tried to escape from the youma's hands.</p>

							<p>In contrast to our brave, wise girl Shushou, Kiwa showed a totally different picture. Kiwa appeared 116 times in the novel, showing up with Shushou 36 times. Though Kiwa seemed to be charitable and well-prepared at the start, he exposed increasingly foolish and self-serving throughout the journey. He brought an excessively large retinue of servants and material goods to ensure his comfort and as gifts for <a href="#Kyouki" class="setting_text2 scrolly">Kyouki</a>. Even in the most dangerous situations, Kiwa refused to part with the caravan that he travels in. He eventually fled with his caravan, abandoning his retinue to the dangers of the <a href="#YellowSea" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Yellow Sea</a>.</p>

							<p>At the end of the novel, when Shushou arrived in <a href="#MountHou" class="setting_text5 scrolly">Mount Hou</a>, the kirin, Kyouki, walked up to her and knelt down, telling her “I could sense your Imperial spirit all the way from Mount Hou.” Gankyuu, Rikou and other people were very happy. To their surprise, the little girl biffed the big man across the top of his head.</p>

							<p>“Then why didn’t you show up when I was born, you darned silly fool!”</p>

							<p>After that, Shushou has ruled Kyou over 90 years.</p>
							<a class="image featured"><img src="images/shushou90.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p class="image_text" style="text-align: center;">Shushou is talking with Kyouki.</p>

	<p>It’s a story took place over 500 years ago before Youko became the empress of Kei. The country En was gradually becoming more stable under Shouryuu’s rule, although it still has a long way to go before it's as beautiful and prosperous as it is in Youko's time, 500 years later.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, not everybody is happy with Shouryuu and his laid-back style of governance. Atsuyu, the self-proclaimed regent of the province of Gen in the kingdom of En, tried to seize power by having the kirin of En, Rokuta, kidnapped. He thought he can do better than Shouryuu.</p>
	<p>When Rokuta was kidnapped, he was asked by his friend, Kouya, who was a loyal follower for Atsuyu, why Rokuta chose Shouryuu as the emperor of En. And Rokuta told him their story.</p>
